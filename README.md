# Recommendations for Images, Assets, and Fonts

## Images

### Portfolio Images (`/images/`)
I recommend using high-quality photography in these categories:

1. **For photo1.jpg - photo8.jpg (Portfolio Grid):**
   - Landscape photography (wide vistas, dramatic lighting)
   - Portrait photography (professional headshots)
   - Street photography (urban moments)
   - Architectural photography (interesting structures)
   - Nature/macro photography (detailed close-ups)
   - Abstract photography (patterns, textures)

2. **For portrait.jpg (About Page):**
   - Professional headshot with neutral background
   - Side profile or three-quarter view
   - Good lighting that highlights facial features

3. **For project1.jpg - project3.jpg (Featured Projects):**
   - Complete series from a single project
   - Event coverage samples
   - Client work examples

4. **For behind1.jpg - behind3.jpg (Behind the Scenes):**
   - Photos of you working on location
   - Equipment setup shots
   - Editing workspace images

### Image Sources
- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - Completely free, high-quality images
- **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Free stock photos
- **Pixabay** (pixabay.com) - Free stock images
- For a professional site, consider purchasing from **Adobe Stock** or **Shutterstock**

## Assets

### Icons (`/icons/`)
- Create a simple favicon.png (32x32px) that matches your branding
- SVG social icons are already included in the HTML

### Watermark
- Simple text or small logo with 40-50% opacity
- Position in bottom right corner
- Keep it unobtrusive

## Font Recommendations

While the site already uses Playfair Display, Inter, and Poppins (excellent choices), here are some alternative professional photography-oriented fonts:

### Serif Fonts (for headings)
- **Cormorant Garamond** - Elegant, thin serifs with high contrast
- **Baskerville** - Classic, refined typography
- **Crimson Text** - Warm, readable serif
- **Lora** - Contemporary serif with balanced proportions

### Sans-Serif Fonts (for body text)
- **Source Sans Pro** - Clean, versatile sans-serif
- **Montserrat** - Modern geometric sans-serif
- **Work Sans** - Minimal, contemporary family
- **Spectral** - Designed specifically for screen reading

### Accent Fonts
- **Raleway** - Elegant sans-serif with distinctive "w"
- **Karla** - Grotesque sans-serif with character
- **DM Sans** - Low-contrast, geometric sans-serif

All these fonts are available on Google Fonts and can be implemented with the same link pattern you're using now:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant+Garamond:wght@400;600&family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@400;600&family=Raleway:wght@500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

For a cohesive design, I recommend sticking with the fonts already specified in your CSS (Playfair Display, Inter, and Poppins) as they create an excellent typography hierarchy that suits a photography portfolio.
